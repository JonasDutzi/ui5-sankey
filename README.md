## Preparation

Use `npm` (or `yarn`) to install the dependencies:

## Run the Library

Execute the following command to run the library locally for development in watch mode (the browser reloads the app automatically when there are changes in the source code):

```sh
npm start
```

As shown in the terminal after executing this command, the app is then running on http://localhost:8080/. A browser window with the URL pointing to your controls' test page should automatically open.
